# FULL STACK APP FOR NON-PROFIT ORG
This app is for people who work at a shelter for orpahned or displaced children. 

The purpose is to be able to manage the shelters and the children they are providing for. 

There is a place to edit shelter information as it changes (occupancy, budget, location, etc)

The app can also add, edit, and delete child info based on the shelter the child is housed.

It's meant to be simple and easy to use for those who have little resources and need a quick and effective way to help those in need.

UNSOLVED PROPLEMS:

The time given I was unable to finish the child controller.js in my app.

NOTE TO SELF:

Finish the childController.js and the views.
Also add styling to the pages so the user interface is clean and simple to use.

I would also like to be able to apply full CRud to my users, add requirements for the login, and also restrict users (but thats a far reach goal from now 2/26/18)
